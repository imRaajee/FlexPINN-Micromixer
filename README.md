# PINN Micromixer – Extra Codes and Results

This repository contains **sample codes, geometries, and additional results** from a project where we used **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to simulate a **3D micromixer** with various fin shapes, orientations, and Reynolds numbers.

The main objective of the project was to explore the effect of geometric and flow variations on mixing efficiency within micromixers, validated against COMSOL results.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- `/code/` – Python scripts demonstrating geometry creation and sample simulations.
- `/geometry/` – Micromixer geometry data (e.g., coordinates of fins or channel structure).
- `/results/` – Sample visual results and figures (e.g., mixing index vs. Re, flow visualization).
- `README.md` – You're here.
- `requirements.txt` – Python package requirements (optional but recommended).

## 📦 Dependencies

The sample code requires the following libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyDOE import lhs
Make sure to install pyDOE since it is not included in the standard Python distribution:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyDOE
To install all dependencies (if requirements.txt is included):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PINN-micromixer-extras.git
cd PINN-micromixer-extras/code
Then run any of the example scripts:

bash
Copy
Edit
python generate_geometry.py
Each script includes comments explaining the purpose and expected outputs.

📂 Applications
These codes are meant to support and extend the results shared in our main article. They can be used for:

Generating or modifying micromixer geometries.

Visualizing fin placement and flow domain.

Performing basic sampling using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).

Exploring parameter variations across different Reynolds numbers.

📌 Notes
This is not the full PINN training code – only supporting scripts and data are provided here.

COMSOL validation and in-depth training routines are discussed in the main publication.
